description: What happens when the hardscrabble cowboys of the Wild West are introduced
  to the latest in twentieth-century technology? In some cases, they take to the sky
  as the daring pilots who are preparing the country to go to war. The Thunder Bird
  is the sequel to B. M. Bower's earlier novel Skyrider, and it packs in just as much
  aerial excitement as its predecessor.
